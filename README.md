## Hi there 👋


**NicatAsk99/NicatAsk99** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
### 👤 About Me

I am a fourth-year History student at Ganja State University with a strong interest in **Cybersecurity, Public Policy, Environment, and International Affairs**. I have international study experience and am currently focused on expanding my academic knowledge while continuously improving my language skills in **English, Turkish, and Russian**.

I enjoy learning new concepts, broadening my perspective across different disciplines, and spending my free time reading books, watching documentaries, and exploring research-based topics. In the future, I plan to pursue a **master’s degree** to further enhance both my academic and personal development.

In addition to my academic background, I have solid skills in **Microsoft Office** applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and practical experience in preparing official documents and creating clear, professional presentations.
